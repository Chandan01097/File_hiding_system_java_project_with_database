# 📁 File Hiding System

## 📝 **Project Overview**

The **File Hiding System** is a Java-based application designed to help users securely hide and unhide files on their local system. In addition to file concealment, the system incorporates **authentication via email verification**, ensuring that only authorized users can access or manage hidden files. The project leverages **Java Mail API** to send OTPs (One-Time Passwords) for secure verification.

## 🚀 **Features**

✅ Hide sensitive files securely from plain sight  
✅ Unhide files with ease after authentication  
✅ Email-based OTP authentication (using **Java Mail API**)  
✅ Relational database integration for managing user data  
✅ Simple and intuitive Java Swing/JavaFX GUI (if you’re using one)  
✅ Error handling and logging for better debugging  
✅ Platform-independent (runs on any system with Java installed)

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **Java (Core)**
- **Java Mail API** for email verification  
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** (or your choice of DB) for storing user info  
- **JDBC** for database connectivity  
- **Maven/Gradle** (if applicable) for dependency management

---

## 🔐 **How It Works**

1. User registers or logs in.  
2. System generates an OTP and sends it via email for verification.  
3. Upon successful OTP verification, users gain access to hide/unhide files.  
4. All file actions are tracked and authorized securely via the database.

## 📦 **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Configure your **`config.properties`** (or wherever you keep your DB/email creds).  
3. Run the project from your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans).  
4. Make sure your **database** and **SMTP settings** are set up correctly.  
5. Enjoy hiding your files like a cyber-ninja 🥷.

## 💡 **Future Improvements**

- Add AES encryption for an extra layer of file protection  
- Role-based user access  
- Multi-factor authentication  
- Better UI/UX with animations (because why not?)  
- Logging system with Log4j or SLF4J
