# 📁 File Hiding System

## 📝 **Project Overview** Introducing the File Hiding System — your sleek, Java-powered digital vault for keeping files under wraps and out of sight! This isn’t just any file concealment tool. It’s built for privacy warriors who mean business.

Here’s the real kicker: it comes with email-based OTP authentication, so only you (yes, you) can access or manage your hidden files. No sneaky business here.

Using the Java Mail API, the system fires off a secure One-Time Password straight to your inbox — no OTP, no access. It’s like two-factor authentication, but cooler.

## 🚀 **Features**

✅ Hide sensitive files securely from plain sight  
✅ Unhide files with ease after authentication  
✅ Email-based OTP authentication (using **Java Mail API**)  
✅ Relational database integration for managing user data  
✅ Simple and intuitive Java Swing/JavaFX GUI (if you’re using one)  
✅ Error handling and logging for better debugging  
✅ Platform-independent (runs on any system with Java installed)

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **Java (Core)**
- **Java Mail API** for email verification  
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** (or your choice of DB) for storing user info  
- **JDBC** for database connectivity  
- **Maven/Gradle** (if applicable) for dependency management

## 🔐 **How It Works**

1. User registers or logs in.  
2. System generates an OTP and sends it via email for verification.  
3. Upon successful OTP verification, users gain access to hide/unhide files.  
4. All file actions are tracked and authorized securely via the database.

## 📦 **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Configure your **`config.properties`** (or wherever you keep your DB/email creds).  
3. Run the project from your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans).  
4. Make sure your **database** and **SMTP settings** are set up correctly.  
5. Enjoy hiding your files like a cyber-ninja 🥷.

## 💡 **Future Improvements**

- Add AES encryption for an extra layer of file protection  
- Role-based user access  
- Multi-factor authentication  
- Better UI/UX with animations (because why not?)  
- Logging system with Log4j or SLF4J
